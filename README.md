# pixelpalette

Web-based image pixelator with colour palette selection for pixel artists and game developers

![demo](https://github.com/D3REKZHANG/pixelpalette/blob/master/demo.gif?raw=true)

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Built with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Material UI**. 

Allows users upload their own image and adjust pixel resolution. There are two pixelation options, Sharp and Soft.

Colour palettes change each pixel in the image to the closest colour in the palette. Contrast option goes by closest true colour difference, while vibrant projects the image into greyscale and picks according to brightness.
